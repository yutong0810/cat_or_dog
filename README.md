# Image Classification using CNN model and ResNet moel 

## Introduction 
#### This project aims to build and train deep learning models to classify cat pictures from dog pictures. We start with resizing and converting the pictures to grayscale. After storing the pictures in a resice folder, we train a simple CNN model, a 4_convolution cnn model, and 6_convolution cnn model with 30 epoches. We also feed colored pictures in to compare results, using accuracy and f1 score as evulation matrix. 

## Source
### The data is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats.) There was 25000 pictures provided in the train data. For the purpose of our project, we will only be uing a 2000 pictures to train our model (1000 dog & 1000 cat.)
